__Welcome to My Space!__

I thought of making this to share my ideas, thoughts and experiences.

Not sure how it works yet tho.

## My First Issue

with building this page on github is  `github pages` is limited to few `Jekyll` themes.

If you can help me build this, please do. I'm available on discord.

### Why?

Cause I'm actually interested in Jekyll. I thought of using it sometime. But it seems like there's some learning curve.
Mainly with `restrictions` applied from `github pages`.
